        <h2>The Evolution of Ice Cream</h2>

            First ice creams appeared in ancient Persia, some 2500 years ago, and in those early times they were all
            based on the sweetened water that was iced,
            grinded into little pieces and then decorated with various tasting toppings and fruits. This tradition of
            ice cream production slowly reached Greek and
            Roman empires, where ice creams were welcomed with opened hands and used liberally by Roman nobility and
            royalty who had necessary money to fund very
            expensive process of production. Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from
            mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice
            cream continued to be even more expensive product. Little changed in the 1000 years following the fall of
            Rome, and only after the Europe started exiting
            Dark Ages did ice cream managed to resurface in Renaissance Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
            During 13th and 14th century, Italy was center of the trade with the Middle East and Asia, and their
            contact with new and innovative recipes of ice cream
            enabled this summertime treat to slowly spread across entire Europe. This expansion of ice cream was
            not an easy one, and it happened only after Italian
            noblewoman Catherine de'Medici went to France to marry Duke de Orleans (future king of France) in
            1533. There she introduced nobility of continental Europe
            with the wonders of the east – eating utensils, high heeled shoes and off course, ice cream. With
            nobility fueling its production, innovators, technicians
            and cooks all put their best efforts into developing the rise of ice cream popularity and
            availability across the world. North American street vendors
            started selling ice cream only few decades after France and England, and industrial revolution
            slowly but surely started working on elevating problems of
            continuous refrigeration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution to that problem came only in 1926, when continuous refrigeration finally became reality
            with electrical freezers. This enabled industrial
            manufacturers to start producing very large quantities of this frozen treat, which slashed ice
            creams price to the acceptable levels for everyone. Large
            popularity of ice cream in United States (especially during prohibition and market crash of 1930s)
            did not shifted to Europe until the start of the World
            War II. After WW2, ice cream industry received massive expansion, enabling creation of countless ice
            cream flavors, artificial ingredients and accessible
            price. Today, ice cream industry earns dozens of billions of dollars each year, with United States
            being the largest consumer of this phenomenal summertime
            treat.
